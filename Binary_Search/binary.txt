What is binary search ?

In binary search we can not traverse over first index.
Binary search always works on sorted array, if array was not sorted so, then its not work.
Binary search is algorithm to find the element in array at less time.
In binary search first we find the array midddle index and middle value compare to the target.
If target is less then mid then we traverse the left side and if target is greater then we traverse right side.
Binary search is taken time to achive its target at (O(logn)) time complexity.


<---------- Algorithm ---------->

Declare start = 0 and end = array.length - 1 
Find the middle index -> middle = start + ( end - start)/2
Traverse the loop while(start <= end)
Compare the middle element to the target
If(middle_element == target) then return middle index 
If(middle_element < target) then we are tarverse to the right side like (start = middle + 1) 
Else we traverse left side of array 
At the end we update the middle value using middle 
Then if target not exists in array we are return -1 or something else 


<---------- pseudo code ------------->

First we have to declare starting and ending point of array
Then find the middle index 
After finding middle index we traverse over the array
And compare middle element to the target if target is equal to the middle value
Then we are return the middle index
if target not equals to the middle value then we are going left or right side 
if target is greater we are going to right side for checking target present or not 
Else we are going to left side for checking target present or not 
Then update the middle index 
And at the end if target not present in array we are return the -1


<------------- Iteravtive code -------------->

int start = 0, end - arr.length -1 ;
while(start <= end){
    int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
    if(arr[mid] == target) return mid;

    if(arr[mid] < target){
        start = mid + 1;
    }
    else{
        end = mid - 1 ;
    }
}

<------------- Recursive Code ------------------>

binary(int[] arr, int target, int start, int end){
    
    if(start > end){
        return -1;
    }

    int mid = start + (end - start)/2;

    if(arr[mid] == target){
        return mid;
    }
    else if(arr[mid] < target){
        return binary(int[] arr, int target, mid + 1, int end)
    }
    
    return binary(int[] arr, int target, int start, mid - 1);
    

}
